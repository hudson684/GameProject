Today:

Had meeting with liam where we worked out how to merge the player control code and the player animation code so that we dont need two almost identicle coding systems.


Added object avoidance for the walker. a box or small object that the walker doesn't expect will cause the walker to jump over them. If it is a larger wall it will rotate to the correct direction and keep going.
