Work for today

smaller workload, as i only have about 2 hours total for working on the game today (will suppliment this with a full day of work tomorrow). Most of todays work is prep and settup.

Things that need to be done (will update as i do)

-As requested by Liam move code into _scripts folder (done)
-fix problems that moving the code will cause
-Grapple bugs:

sugestion: Have the grapple always shoot, and only retract if it doesnt hit anything?

Grappling onto other objects that are moving faster than the grapple.

Grappling while touching the ground should still allow you to walk?
sub point: walking on the ground while holding an object

Grappling while in zero g should be a different control scheme?

Grappling in zero g while on an object not a wall.

note: will not get all of this done today, but will work on this today and tomorrow.


other things to do:
- redo the player character to remove dependancies on seperate invisable objects, get grapple attached to the arm instead of the fake arm.

-Prove mantle works, fully impliment it into game
